sort leaderboard by cash + book value

drop column position outcome_price_post_transaction
drop column outcome.start_price

== Closed markets ==
- add field to outcome to show that it was the selected outcome
- markets index: should be able to hide/show closed markets (or maybe separate page for closed markets)






== Get trading working == 
Admin - give $100 to some number of investors that I choose

== Administration == 
Admin - should have to log in to do admin-type activities 
	-> not sure how to make privileged account with authlogic
	-> not sure how this works with webrat

== Market display == 
Leaderboard - as an investor, i'd like to see how I stand relative to others. So I'd like to sort by net worth (cash + market value in each market)
	-> not sure how to sort by an object field in ruby :-(
	-> maybe get pdf of pickaxe book?
	-> how to format cash so that it has 2 decimal places?
	
Leaderboard - as a user, for a market I'd like to see my holdings in the market
Leaderboard - as a user, for a market I'd like to see a chart for the price changes in each outcome for a market
Investor - see a list of all the markets that have closed and how I did in that market


== Perform trades == 
Investor - sell shares in an outcome that I have a position. If I don't have a position, I shouldn't be able to sell.
Market maker - buy shares from a user when the user tries to sell
Market maker - when I buy/sell shares from a user, I'd like to adjust the price for the outcome that the user bought sold. In doing this, I also need to adjust the prices for the other outcomes in the market so that they all add to $100
Market maker - each time I adjust the price for an outcome, I would like to log the new value to the database

== Market closing == 
Admin - close a market. I should select the winning outcome and then investors should be paid.
Leaderboard - as a user, I'd like to hide/show closed markets


== User management == 
* User management - create an account
* User management - login
* User management - logout
? User management - email confirmation for account creation
